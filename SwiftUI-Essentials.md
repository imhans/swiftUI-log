Creating and Combining Views 

SwiftUI app life cycle has a structure that conforms to the App protocol
The structure's body property returns one or more scencs, which in turn provide content for display
The @main attribute identifies the app's entry point 

Body property
*only returns a single view 

View files declare two structures by default
*First structure: conforms to the View protocol and describes the view's content and layoout
*Second structure: declares a preview for that view

Customizing views
*can customize a view's display by changing code or using the inspector
*depending on the type of view you inspect it shows different attributes
*Modifiers also let you customize your view, which returns a new view

Combining views using stacks
*you can combine and embed multiple views in stacks, which group views together horizontally, verticall, or back-to-front

Spacer
*expands to make its containing view use all of the space of its parent view, instead of defining itself
*For example, a Spacer() inside HStack will affect the HStack, not the other views that the HStack contains

Image view
*clipShape(Circle): Circle type is a shape that you can use as a mask or as a view by giving the circle a stroke or fill

Views from other frameworks
*import statement required to use other frameworks

@State attribute
*allow us to modify values inside a struct, which would normally not be allowed because structs are value types
*By prefixing a state variable with $, you pass a binding, which is like a reference to the underlying value. When the user interacts with the map, the map updates the region value to match the part of the map thatâ€™s currently visible in the user interface

Building Lists and Navigation

Codable conformance
*makes it easier to load data into a structure from a data file

Types
*Image type: SwiftUI has to be imported
*a nested type(Coordinates) can be created as a structure 
*CLLocationCoordinate2D type: import CoreLocation is required and is useful for interacting with MapKit framework

Create an Array

ModelData
load(_: ) method 
*it is to fetch data with a given name from the app's main bundle
*relies on the return type's conformance to the Codable protocol
*(_:) is used to define that the parameter is not named

guard-let vs if-let
*guard-let requires early return and else statement
*variables in if-let exists only inside the block

Customizing the Row Preview

Preview Provider Protocol
*Xcode's canvas automatically recognizes and displays any type in the current editor that conforms to the Preview Provide Protocol
*A Preview Provider protocol returns one or more views, with options to configure the size and device

Group
*is a container for grouping view content
*Xcode renders the group's child views as seperate previews in the canvas
