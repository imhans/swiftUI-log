SwiftUI app life cycle has a structure that conforms to the App protocol
The structure's body property returns one or more scencs, which in turn provide content for display
The @main attribute identifies the app's entry point 

View files declare two structures by default
-First structure: conforms to the View protocol and describes the view's content and layoout
-Second structure: declares a preview for that view
